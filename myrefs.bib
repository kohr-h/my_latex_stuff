	abstract = {Total variation methods and similar approaches based on regularizations with ℓ 1-type norms (and seminorms) have become a very popular tool in image processing and inverse problems due to peculiar features that cannot be realized with smooth regularizations. In particular total variation techniques had particular success due to their ability to realize cartoon-type reconstructions with sharp edges. Due to an explosion of new developments in this field within the last decade it is a difficult task to keep an overview of the major results in analysis, the computational schemes, and the application fields. With these lectures we attempt to provide such an overview, of course biased by our major lines of research. We are focusing on the basic analysis of total variation methods and the extension of the original ROF-denoising model due various application fields. Furthermore we provide a brief discussion of state-of-the art computational methods and give an outlook to applications in different disciplines.},

	abstract = {The resolution of cryo-electron tomography can be limited by the first zero of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF). To achieve higher resolution, it is critical to determine the \{CTF\} and correct its phase inversions. However, the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the defocus gradient in the projections of tilted specimens make this process challenging. Two programs, \{CTFPLOTTER\} and CTFPHASEFLIP, have been developed to address these issues. \{CTFPLOTTER\} obtains a 1D power spectrum by periodogram averaging and rotational averaging and it estimates the noise background with a novel approach, which uses images taken with no specimen. The background-subtracted 1D power spectra from image regions at different defocus values are then shifted to align their first zeros and averaged together. This averaging improves the \{SNR\} sufficiently that it becomes possible to determine the defocus for subsets of the tilt series rather than just the entire series. \{CTFPHASEFLIP\} corrects images line-by-line by inverting phases appropriately in thin strips of the image at nearly constant defocus. \{CTF\} correction by these methods is shown to improve the resolution of aligned, averaged particles extracted from tomograms. However, some restoration of Fourier amplitudes at high frequencies is important for seeing the benefits from \{CTF\} correction.},

The principle of feature reconstruction is adapted from bounded operators to the unbounded scenario and, in addition, a new situation is examined where the data need to be pre-processed to fit into the mathematical model. In all these cases, invariance and regularization properties are surveyed and established for the example of fractional differentiation. Numerical results confirm the derived characteristics of the presented methods.},

	abstract = {NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first and largest complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The bovine complex purified from cardiac muscle consists of at least 42 different subunits with a combined molecular mass of about 890 kDa. The three-dimensional structure of the complex was determined at 22 Å from single particles embedded in vitrified ice using electron cryo-microscopy. The structure was calculated using a new program to align particles, to correct for the contrast transfer function of the microscope, and to carry out the three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex. The bovine complex has the overall L-shaped appearance found in earlier studies of the closely related complex I from Neurospora crassa, but it differs by having a thin stalk region linking the membrane-bound globular arm with the intrinsic membrane domain. Thus, the stalk which measures about 30 Å in diameter is likely to contain part of the electron transfer pathway linking the \{NADH\} binding site in the globular arm with the ubiquinone binding site in the membrane domain. The globular domain of bovine complex I is significantly bigger than that of the N. crassa enzyme, suggesting that the apparent additional subunit complexity of the bovine enzyme is associated with the globular part.},

	abstract = {Electron cryotomography (cryoET) has the potential to elucidate the structure of complex biological specimens at molecular resolution but technical and computational improvements are still needed. This work addresses the determination and correction of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the electron microscope in cryoET. Our approach to \{CTF\} detection and defocus determination depends on strip-based periodogram averaging, extended throughout the tilt series to overcome the low contrast conditions found in cryoET. A method for \{CTF\} correction that deals with the defocus gradient in images of tilted specimens is also proposed. These approaches to \{CTF\} determination and correction have been applied here to several examples of cryoET of pleomorphic specimens and of single particles. \{CTF\} correction is essential for improving the resolution, particularly in those studies that combine cryoET with single particle averaging techniques.},

Based on the concept of approximate inverse, we derive an algorithm of filtered backprojection type which is much faster than the frequently used iterative methods. Numerical tests with simulated and measured transmission electron microscope data and comparisons with other FBP-type methods reveal that our algorithm provides reconstructions with high contrast and resolution, while the noise level is significantly reduced.},

	abstract = {The proximity operator of a convex function is a natural extension of the notion of a projection operator onto a convex set. This tool, which plays a central role in the analysis and the numerical solution of convex optimization problems, has recently been introduced in the arena of inverse problems and, especially, in signal processing, where it has become increasingly important. In this paper, we review the basic properties of proximity operators which are relevant to signal processing and present optimization methods based on these operators. These proximal splitting methods are shown to capture and extend several well-known algorithms in a unifying framework. Applications of proximal methods in signal recovery and synthesis are discussed.},

Our framework builds on connections between the Fisher--Rao information metric on the space of probability densities and right-invariant metrics on the infinite-dimensional manifold of diffeomorphisms.	This optimal information transport, and modifications thereof, allow us to construct numerical algorithms for density matching. The algorithms are inherently more efficient than those based on optimal mass transport or diffeomorphic registration.	Our methods have applications in medical image registration, texture mapping, image morphing, nonuniform random sampling, and mesh adaptivity. Some of these applications are illustrated in examples.},

The approach is simple: a mapping is called smooth if it maps smooth curves to smooth curves. Up to Fréchet spaces, this notion of smoothness coincides with all known reasonable concepts. In the same spirit, calculus of holomorphic mappings (including Hartogs' theorem and holomorphic uniform boundedness theorems) and calculus of real analytic mappings are developed. Existence of smooth partitions of unity, the foundations of manifold theory in infinite dimensions, the relation between tangent vectors and derivations, and differential forms are discussed thoroughly. Special emphasis is given to the notion of regular infinite dimensional Lie groups. Many applications of this theory are included: manifolds of smooth mappings, groups of diffeomorphisms, geodesics on spaces of Riemannian metrics, direct limit manifolds, perturbation theory of operators, and differentiability questions of infinite dimensional representations.},

	abstract = {By computerized tomography (CT) we mean the reconstruction of a function from its line or plane integrals, irrespective of the field where this technique is applied. In the early 1970s CT was introduced in diagnostic radiology and since then, many other applications of CT have become known, some of them preceding the application in radiology by many years. In this book I have made an attempt to collect some mathematics which is of possible interest both to the research mathematician who wants to understand the theory and algorithms of CT and to the practitioner who wants to apply CT in his special field of interest. I also want to present the state of the art of the mathematical theory of CT as it has developed from 1970 on. It seems that essential parts of the theory are now well understood. In the selection of the material I restricted myself—with very few exceptions—to the original problem of CT, even though extensions to other problems of integral geometry, such as reconstruction from integrals over arbitrary manifolds are possible in some cases. This is because the field is presently developing rapidly and its final shape is not yet visible. Another glaring omission is the statistical side of CT which is very important in practice and which we touch on only occasionally. The book is intended to be self-contained and the necessary mathematical background is briefly reviewed in an appendix (Chapter VII). A familiarity with the material of that chapter is required throughout the book. In the main text I have tried to be mathematically rigorous in the statement and proof of the theorems, but I do not hesitate in giving a loose interpretation of mathematical facts when this helps to understand its practical relevance. The book arose from courses on the mathematics of CT I taught at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Münster. I owe much to the enthusiasm and diligence of my students, many of whom did their diploma thesis with me. Thanks are due to D. C. Solmon and E. T. Quinto, who, during their stay in Münster which has been made possible by the Humboldt–Stiftung, not only read critically parts of the manuscript and suggested major improvements but also gave their advice in the preparation of the book. I gratefully acknowledge the help of A. Faridani, U. Heike and H. Kruse without whose support the book would never have been finished. Last but not least I want to thank Mrs I. Berg for her excellent typing. Frank Natterer Münster, July 1985},

	abstract = {Since the advent of computerized tomography in the seventies, many imaging techniques have emerged and have been introduced in radiology, science, and technology. Some of these techniques are now in routine use, most are still under development, and others are the subject of mainly academic research, their future usefulness in debate. This book makes an attempt to describe these techniques in a mathematical language, to provide the adequate mathematical background and the necessary mathematical tools. In particular, it gives a detailed analysis of numerical algorithms for image reconstruction. We concentrate on the developments of the last 10 to 15 years. Previous results are given without proof, except when new proofs are available. It is assumed that, or at least helpful if, the reader is familiar with the tomography literature of the eighties. The backbone of the theory of imaging is still integral geometry. We survey this field as far as is necessary for imaging purposes. Imaging techniques based on or related to integral geometry are briefly described in the section on tomography. In contrast, the section on algorithms is fairly detailed, at least in the two-dimensional (2D) case. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we derive exact and approximate inversion formulas for specific imaging devices. We describe their algorithmic implementation, which largely parallels the 2D case. The development in the field of algorithms is still quite lively, in particular in the 3D area. While some fundamental principles, such as filtered backprojection, seem to be well established, much of this section may well turn out to be just a snapshot of the present scene. General trends, such as the present revival of Fourier and iterative methods, become visible. In the last part of the book we deal with imaging techniques that are usually referred to as tomography but that are only remotely related to the straight line paradigm of tomography. These can be formulated as bilinear inverse problems of partial differential equations. We give a common framework and describe simple numerical methods based on standard iterative techniques of tomography. The book is aimed at mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and other scientists with the appropriate mathematical skills who want to understand the theoretical foundations of image reconstruction and to solve concrete problems. Often the proofs are sketchy or even missing in cases in which suitable references are easily available. We hope that the readability does not suffer from these omissions, which are necessary to keep this report at a reasonable length.},

By imposing certain conditions on the random noise, we establish four convergence results; one relies on the source conditions and the other three do not depend on any source conditions. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance.},

	abstract = {Inverse problems with Poisson data arise in many photonic imaging modalities in medicine, engineering and astronomy. The design of regularization methods and estimators for such problems has been studied intensively over the last two decades. In this review we give an overview of statistical regularization theory for such problems, the most important applications, and the most widely used algorithms. The focus is on variational regularization methods in the form of penalized maximum likelihood estimators, which can be analyzed in a general setup. Complementing a number of recent convergence rate results we will establish consistency results. Moreover, we discuss estimators based on a wavelet-vaguelette decomposition of the (necessarily linear) forward operator. As most prominent applications we briefly introduce Positron emission tomography, inverse problems in fluorescence microscopy, and phase retrieval problems. The computation of a penalized maximum likelihood estimator involves the solution of a (typically convex) minimization problem. We also review several efficient algorithms which have been proposed for such problems over the last five years.},

We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O(ωN) for some ω∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},
