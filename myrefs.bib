	abstract = {NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first and largest complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The bovine complex purified from cardiac muscle consists of at least 42 different subunits with a combined molecular mass of about 890 kDa. The three-dimensional structure of the complex was determined at 22 {\r A} from single particles embedded in vitrified ice using electron cryo-microscopy. The structure was calculated using a new program to align particles, to correct for the contrast transfer function of the microscope, and to carry out the three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex. The bovine complex has the overall L-shaped appearance found in earlier studies of the closely related complex I from Neurospora crassa, but it differs by having a thin stalk region linking the membrane-bound globular arm with the intrinsic membrane domain. Thus, the stalk which measures about 30 {\r A} in diameter is likely to contain part of the electron transfer pathway linking the \{NADH\} binding site in the globular arm with the ubiquinone binding site in the membrane domain. The globular domain of bovine complex I is significantly bigger than that of the N. crassa enzyme, suggesting that the apparent additional subunit complexity of the bovine enzyme is associated with the globular part.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the linear regularization scheme known as the approximate inverse to unbounded linear operators on Banach spaces. The principle of feature reconstruction is adapted from bounded operators to the unbounded scenario and, in addition, a new situation is examined where the data need to be pre-processed to fit into the mathematical model. In all these cases, invariance and regularization properties are surveyed and established for the example of fractional differentiation. Numerical results confirm the derived characteristics of the presented methods.},

Based on the concept of approximate inverse, we derive an algorithm of filtered backprojection type which is much faster than the frequently used iterative methods. Numerical tests with simulated and measured transmission electron microscope data and comparisons with other FBP-type methods reveal that our algorithm provides reconstructions with high contrast and resolution, while the noise level is significantly reduced.},

	abstract = {The resolution of cryo-electron tomography can be limited by the first zero of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF). To achieve higher resolution, it is critical to determine the \{CTF\} and correct its phase inversions. However, the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the defocus gradient in the projections of tilted specimens make this process challenging. Two programs, \{CTFPLOTTER\} and CTFPHASEFLIP, have been developed to address these issues. \{CTFPLOTTER\} obtains a 1D power spectrum by periodogram averaging and rotational averaging and it estimates the noise background with a novel approach, which uses images taken with no specimen. The background-subtracted 1D power spectra from image regions at different defocus values are then shifted to align their first zeros and averaged together. This averaging improves the \{SNR\} sufficiently that it becomes possible to determine the defocus for subsets of the tilt series rather than just the entire series. \{CTFPHASEFLIP\} corrects images line-by-line by inverting phases appropriately in thin strips of the image at nearly constant defocus. \{CTF\} correction by these methods is shown to improve the resolution of aligned, averaged particles extracted from tomograms. However, some restoration of Fourier amplitudes at high frequencies is important for seeing the benefits from \{CTF\} correction.},

In particular total variation techniques had particular success due to their ability to realize cartoon-type reconstructions with sharp edges. Due to an explosion of new developments in this field within the last decade it is a difficult task to keep an overview of the major results in analysis, the computational schemes, and the application fields. With these lectures we attempt to provide such an overview, of course biased by our major lines of research. We are focusing on the basic analysis of total variation methods and the extension of the original ROF-denoising model due various application fields. Furthermore we provide a brief discussion of state-of-the art computational methods and give an outlook to applications in different disciplines.},

This optimal information transport, and modifications thereof, allow us to construct numerical algorithms for density matching. The algorithms are inherently more efficient than those based on optimal mass transport or diffeomorphic registration.	Our methods have applications in medical image registration, texture mapping, image morphing, nonuniform random sampling, and mesh adaptivity. Some of these applications are illustrated in examples.},

The design of regularization methods and estimators for such problems has been studied intensively over the last two decades. In this review we give an overview of statistical regularization theory for such problems, the most important applications, and the most widely used algorithms. The focus is on variational regularization methods in the form of penalized maximum likelihood estimators, which can be analyzed in a general setup. Complementing a number of recent convergence rate results we will establish consistency results. Moreover, we discuss estimators based on a wavelet-vaguelette decomposition of the (necessarily linear) forward operator. As most prominent applications we briefly introduce Positron emission tomography, inverse problems in fluorescence microscopy, and phase retrieval problems. The computation of a penalized maximum likelihood estimator involves the solution of a (typically convex) minimization problem. We also review several efficient algorithms which have been proposed for such problems over the last five years.},

	abstract = {By computerized tomography (CT) we mean the reconstruction of a function from its line or plane integrals, irrespective of the field where this technique is applied. In the early 1970s CT was introduced in diagnostic radiology and since then, many other applications of CT have become known, some of them preceding the application in radiology by many years. In this book I have made an attempt to collect some mathematics which is of possible interest both to the research mathematician who wants to understand the theory and algorithms of CT and to the practitioner who wants to apply CT in his special field of interest. I also want to present the state of the art of the mathematical theory of CT as it has developed from 1970 on. It seems that essential parts of the theory are now well understood. In the selection of the material I restricted myself{\textemdash}with very few exceptions{\textemdash}to the original problem of CT, even though extensions to other problems of integral geometry, such as reconstruction from integrals over arbitrary manifolds are possible in some cases. This is because the field is presently developing rapidly and its final shape is not yet visible. Another glaring omission is the statistical side of CT which is very important in practice and which we touch on only occasionally. The book is intended to be self-contained and the necessary mathematical background is briefly reviewed in an appendix (Chapter VII). A familiarity with the material of that chapter is required throughout the book. In the main text I have tried to be mathematically rigorous in the statement and proof of the theorems, but I do not hesitate in giving a loose interpretation of mathematical facts when this helps to understand its practical relevance. The book arose from courses on the mathematics of CT I taught at the Universities of Saarbr{\"u}cken and M{\"u}nster. I owe much to the enthusiasm and diligence of my students, many of whom did their diploma thesis with me. Thanks are due to D. C. Solmon and E. T. Quinto, who, during their stay in M{\"u}nster which has been made possible by the Humboldt{\textendash}Stiftung, not only read critically parts of the manuscript and suggested major improvements but also gave their advice in the preparation of the book. I gratefully acknowledge the help of A. Faridani, U. Heike and H. Kruse without whose support the book would never have been finished. Last but not least I want to thank Mrs I. Berg for her excellent typing. Frank Natterer M{\"u}nster, July 1985},

	abstract = {Since the advent of computerized tomography in the seventies, many imaging techniques have emerged and have been introduced in radiology, science, and technology. Some of these techniques are now in routine use, most are still under development, and others are the subject of mainly academic research, their future usefulness in debate. This book makes an attempt to describe these techniques in a mathematical language, to provide the adequate mathematical background and the necessary mathematical tools. In particular, it gives a detailed analysis of numerical algorithms for image reconstruction. We concentrate on the developments of the last 10 to 15 years. Previous results are given without proof, except when new proofs are available. It is assumed that, or at least helpful if, the reader is familiar with the tomography literature of the eighties. The backbone of the theory of imaging is still integral geometry. We survey this field as far as is necessary for imaging purposes. Imaging techniques based on or related to integral geometry are briefly described in the section on tomography. In contrast, the section on algorithms is fairly detailed, at least in the two-dimensional (2D) case. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we derive exact and approximate inversion formulas for specific imaging devices. We describe their algorithmic implementation, which largely parallels the 2D case. The development in the field of algorithms is still quite lively, in particular in the 3D area. While some fundamental principles, such as filtered backprojection, seem to be well established, much of this section may well turn out to be just a snapshot of the present scene. General trends, such as the present revival of Fourier and iterative methods, become visible. In the last part of the book we deal with imaging techniques that are usually referred to as tomography but that are only remotely related to the straight line paradigm of tomography. These can be formulated as bilinear inverse problems of partial differential equations. We give a common framework and describe simple numerical methods based on standard iterative techniques of tomography. The book is aimed at mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and other scientists with the appropriate mathematical skills who want to understand the theoretical foundations of image reconstruction and to solve concrete problems. Often the proofs are sketchy or even missing in cases in which suitable references are easily available. We hope that the readability does not suffer from these omissions, which are necessary to keep this report at a reasonable length.},

The approach is simple: a mapping is called smooth if it maps smooth curves to smooth curves. Up to Fr{\'e}chet spaces, this notion of smoothness coincides with all known reasonable concepts. In the same spirit, calculus of holomorphic mappings (including Hartogs' theorem and holomorphic uniform boundedness theorems) and calculus of real analytic mappings are developed. Existence of smooth partitions of unity, the foundations of manifold theory in infinite dimensions, the relation between tangent vectors and derivations, and differential forms are discussed thoroughly. Special emphasis is given to the notion of regular infinite dimensional Lie groups. Many applications of this theory are included: manifolds of smooth mappings, groups of diffeomorphisms, geodesics on spaces of Riemannian metrics, direct limit manifolds, perturbation theory of operators, and differentiability questions of infinite dimensional representations.},

This work addresses the determination and correction of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the electron microscope in cryoET. Our approach to CTF detection and defocus determination depends on strip-based periodogram averaging, extended throughout the tilt series to overcome the low contrast conditions found in cryoET. A method for CTF correction that deals with the defocus gradient in images of tilted specimens is also proposed. These approaches to CTF determination and correction have been applied here to several examples of cryoET of pleomorphic specimens and of single particles. CTF correction is essential for improving the resolution, particularly in those studies that combine cryoET with single particle averaging techniques.},

	abstract = {This review of the development and current status of electron tomography deals mainly with the mathematical and algorithmic aspects. After a very brief description of the role of electron tomography in structural biology, we turn our attention to the derivation of the forward operator. Starting from the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, the electron{\textendash}specimen interaction is modelled as a diffraction tomography problem and the picture is completed by adding a description of the optical system of the transmission electron microscope. The first-order Born approximation enables one to explicitly express the intensity for any finite wavenumber in terms of the propagation operator acting on the specimen convolved with a point spread function, derived from the optics in the transmission electron microscope. Next, we focus on the difficulties that cause the reconstruction problem to be quite challenging. Special emphasis is put on explaining the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in the data combined with the incomplete data problems, which lead to severe ill-posedness. The next step is to derive the standard phase contrast model used in the electron tomography community. The above-mentioned expression for the intensity generalizes the standard phase contrast model which can be obtained by replacing the propagation operator by its high-energy limit, the x-ray transform, as the wavenumber tends to infinity. The importance of more carefully including the wave nature of the electron{\textendash}specimen interaction is supported by performing an asymptotic analysis of the intensity as the wavenumber tends to infinity. Next we provide an overview of the various reconstruction methods that have been employed in electron tomography and we conclude by mentioning a number of open problems. Besides providing an introduction to electron tomography written in the 'language of inverse problems', the authors hope to raise interest among experts in integral geometry and regularization theory for the mathematical and algorithmic difficulties that are encountered in electron tomography.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the imaging and inversion of the constitutive material properties of bounded objects embedded in a known background medium. The inversion utilizes measurements of the scattered field due to the illumination of the objects by a set of known single-frequency wave fields. We present two inverse scattering methods that approximately recast the full nonlinear inversion into a number of linear inversion steps. The two methods are as computationally efficient as the constrained Born inversion but provide reconstruction results that are far superior and are almost comparable in quality to the ones obtained using a full nonlinear iterative inversion. The linear inversion steps follow what is referred to as the source-type integral equation approach in which the contrast sources are inverted for in the first step from the linear data equation. In this step, we employ a local (diagonal) approximation of the operator that relates the contrast sources to the incident field. Once the contrast sources have been determined, the total internal wave fields follow from a direct application of the object equation. In the third and final step, the contrast function is estimated from either the constitutive relation (first method) or from solving the data equation again, this time in terms of the contrast profile (second method). The computational cost required by the first method is comparable to that of a constrained Born inversion. With only twice the computational cost, the second method invariably gives an almost perfect image. We will demonstrate the two methods for a number of representative synthetic examples, both in two and three dimensions.},

In the later chapters, the reader is introduced to the theory of free discontinuity problems, to the space of special functions of bounded variation, and is presented with a detailed analysis of the Mumford-Shah image segmentation problem. Existence, regularity and qualitative properties of solutions are explained and a survey is given on the current knowledge of this challenging mathematical problem. The theory embodies classical problems, e.g. related to phase transitions, or fracture and plasticity in continuum mechanics, as well as more recent ones like edge detection in image analysis.

	abstract = {Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality with applications
ranging from the treatment of cancer, studying neurological diseases and disease models.
Virtual-Pinhole PET technology improves the image quality in terms of resolution and contrast recovery. The technology calls for having a detector with smaller crystals placed near a
region of interest in a conventional whole-body PET scanner. The improvement is from the higher spatial sampling of the imaging area near the detector. A prototype half-ring PET insert built to study head-and-neck cancer imaging was extended to breast cancer imaging. We have built a prototype half-ring PET insert for head-and-neck cancer imaging applications. In the first half of this work, we extend the use of the insert to breast imaging and show that such a system provides high resolution images of breast and axillary lymph nodes while maintaining the full imaging field of view capability of a clinical PET scanner.
We are focused on designing unconventional PET geometries for specific applications. A
general purpose 4D PET reconstruction framework was created to estimate the radionuclide uptake in the subject. Quantitative estimation in PET requires precise modeling of PET physics. Data acquired in a PET scanner is well modeled as a Poisson counting process. Reconstruction given the forward model is implemented using MAP-OSEM. The framework is capable of reconstructing PET data under arbitrary position of the detector elements and
different crystal sizes. A novel symmetry finding algorithm is created to reduce the system
matrix size, without loss of resolution. The framework motivates investigation into different PET system geometries for different applications, as well as optimizing the design of PET systems. A generalized normalization procedure was developed to model unknown components. The programs are parallelized using OpenMP and MPI to run on small workstations as well as supercomputing clusters. The performance of our reconstruction framework is
presented through four novel and unconventional PET systems, each designed specifically for a different geometry. The Virtual-Pinhole half-ring system is a half-ring insert integrated into a Siemens Biograph-40, for head and neck imaging. The Flat-panel system is a modular insert system integrated into the Biograph-40, designed for breast cancer imaging. The MicroInsert II is the second generation full ring insert device, integrated into the MicroPET scanner to improve the resolution and contrast recovery of the MicroPET scanner. The Plant PET system is a PET system designed to image plants vertically, and integrated into a plant growth chamber. The improvement in speed/memory from symmetry finding is as high as a factor of 50 in some cases. Further improvements to the framework and state of
the field are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Phase contrast imaging seeks to reconstruct the complex refractive index of an unknown sample from scattering intensities, measured for example under illumination with coherent x-rays. By incorporating refraction, this method yields improved contrast compared to purely absorption-based radiography but involves a phase retrieval problem which, in general, allows for ambiguous reconstructions. In this paper, we show uniqueness of propagation-based phase contrast imaging for compactly supported objects in the near-field regime, based on a description by the projection- and paraxial approximations. In this setting, propagation is governed by the Fresnel propagator and the unscattered part of the illumination function provides a known reference wave at the detector which facilitates phase reconstruction. The uniqueness theorem is derived using the theory of entire functions. Unlike previous results based on exact solution formulae, it is valid for arbitrary complex objects and requires intensity measurements only at a single detector distance and illumination wavelength. We also deduce a uniqueness criterion for phase contrast tomography, which may be applied to resolve the three-dimensional structure of micro- and nano-scale samples. Moreover, our results may have some significance to electronic imaging methods due to the equivalence of paraxial wave propagation and Schr{\"o}dinger{\textquoteright}s equation.},

Here we focus on reconstruction strategies combining the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and total variation (TV) based regularization, and present a detailed analysis as well as numerical results. Recently extensions of the well known EM/Richardson-Lucy algorithm received increasing attention for inverse problems with Poisson data (Dey et al., 3D microscopy deconvolution using Richardson-Lucy algorithm with total variation regularization, 2004; Jonsson et al., Total variation regularization in positron emission tomography, 1998; Panin et al., IEEE Trans Nucl Sci 46(6):2202{\textendash}2210, 1999). However, most of these algorithms for regularizations like TV lead to convergence problems for large regularization parameters, cannot guarantee positivity, and rely on additional approximations (like smoothed TV). The goal of this lecture is to provide accurate, robust and fast EM-TV based methods for computing cartoon reconstructions facilitating post-segmentation and providing a basis for quantification techniques. We illustrate also the performance of the proposed algorithms and confirm the analytical concepts by 2D and 3D synthetic and real-world results in optical nanoscopy and PET.},

We analytically derive the corresponding backprojection operator as the adjoint of the forward projection. We further demonstrate that the matched backprojection operator drastically improves the convergence rate of iterative 3D reconstruction compared to the case where a backprojection based on heuristic weighting is used. In addition, we show that the 3D reconstruction is of better quality.},

More precisely, we construct boundary shearlet systems that form frames for \$L{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ with controllable frame bounds and admit optimally sparse approximations for functions, which are smooth apart from a curve-like discontinuity. We show that the constructed systems allow for boundary conditions. Furthermore, for \$s {\textbackslash}geq 0\$ and \$f{\textbackslash}in H{\textasciicircum}s({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ we prove that weighted \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}2\$ norms of the analysis coefficients of \$f\$ are equivalent to its \$H{\textasciicircum}s({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ norm.

Moreover, we demonstrate numerically, that the associated synthesis operator is also stable as a map to \$H{\textasciicircum}s({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ which, in combination with the previous result, strongly indicates that these systems even constitute so-called Gelfand frames for \$(H{\textasciicircum}s({\textbackslash}Omega), L{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}Omega), H{\textasciicircum}\{-s\}({\textbackslash}Omega))\$.},

Adding 3D imaging to a mobile fluoroscopic C-arm reduces the cost of CT, as a mobile C-arm is much less expensive than a dedicated CT scanner. In this paper we explore the technical challenges to implementing 3D reconstruction on these devices. One of the biggest challenges is the problem of uncertain geometry; mobile C-arms do not have the same geometric consistency that exists in larger dedicated CT scanners. The geometric parameters of an acquisition scan are therefore uncertain, and a na{\"i}ve reconstruction with these incorrect parameters leads to poor image quality. Our proposed method reconstructs the 3D image using the expectation maximization (EM) framework while jointly estimating the true geometry, thereby improving the feasibility of 3D imaging on mobile C-arms.},

	title = {A method for locally approximating regularized iterative tomographic reconstruction methods},
	abstract = {In many applications of tomography, the acquired projections are either limited in number or contain a significant amount of noise. In these cases, standard reconstruction methods tend to produce artifacts that can make further analysis difficult. Advanced regularized iterative methods, such as total variation minimization, are often able to achieve a higher reconstruction quality by exploiting prior knowledge about the scanned object. In practice, however, these methods often have prohibitively long computation times or large memory requirements. Furthermore, since they are based on minimizing a global objective function, regularized iterative methods need to reconstruct the entire scanned object, even when one is only interested in a (small) region of the reconstructed image. In this paper, we present a method to approximate regularized iterative reconstruction methods inside a (small) region of the scanned object. The method only performs computations inside the region of interest, ensuring low computational requirements. Reconstruction results for different phantom images and types of regularization are given, showing that reconstructions of the proposed local method are almost identical to those of the global regularized iterative methods that are approximated, even for relatively small regions of interest. Furthermore, we show that larger regions can be reconstructed efficiently by reconstructing several small regions in parallel and combining them into a single reconstruction afterwards.},

This criterion is based on estimation of the spatial frequency limit beyond which the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) falls below an acceptable baseline. Applicable to both periodic and aperiodic specimens, this approach is particularly apposite for sets of correlation-averaged images. It represents a straightforward and intuitively appealing generalization of the traditional method of estimating the resolution of crystalline specimens from the spectral ranges of periodic reflections in their diffraction patterns. This method allows one to assess how closely the resolution of an averaged image based on N individual images approaches the ultimate resolution obtainable from an indefinitely large number of statistically equivalent images. Inter-relationships between the SSNR and two other measures of resolution, the differential phase residual and the Fourier ring correlation coefficient, are discussed, and their properties compared.},

A resolution of 20 nm allowed visualization of the individual stalks of the S-layer of Pyrobaculum aerophilum cells, which had undergone partial lysis, in three dimensions. The attainable resolution for low-dose electron tomography under different experimental conditions was theoretically investigated in terms of the specimen thickness. To obtain 2-nm resolution at 120 kV (300 kV), the specimen must not be thicker than 100 nm (150 nm). For a resolution of 10 nm, the maximum thickness is 450 nm (700 nm). An accelerating voltage of 300 kV is advantageous, mainly for specimens thicker than 100 nm.

The 3D dataset was processed by an automated deconvolution procedure. The lateral resolution was 1.1 nm, set by pixel size. Particles differing by only 10 nm in vertical position were identified as separate objects with greater than 20\% dip in contrast between them. We refer to this value as the axial resolution of the deconvolution or reconstruction, the ability to recognize two objects, which were unresolved in the original dataset. The resolution of the reconstruction is comparable to that achieved by tilt-series transmission electron microscopy. However, the focal-series method does not require mechanical tilting and is therefore much faster. 3D STEM images were also recorded of the Golgi ribbon in conventional thin sections containing 3T3 cells with a comparable axial resolution in the deconvolved dataset.},

The final solution is given by a least squares approach, which also indicates how many views must be included to give a valid reconstruction of a given particle to a given degree of resolution. Interpolation procedures of varying power are given, to be employed according to the economy with which the available data must be used.

This imaging mode offers the potential for sub-{\r A}ngstrom lateral resolution and nanometer-scale depth sensitivity. For biological samples, which may be many microns across and where high lateral resolution may not always be needed, optimizing the depth resolution even at the expense of lateral resolution may be desired, aiming to image through thick specimens. Although there has been extensive work examining and optimizing the probe formation in two dimensions, there is less known about the probe shape along the optical axis. Here the probe shape is examined in three dimensions in an attempt to better understand the depth resolution in this mode. Examples are presented of how aberrations change the probe shape in three dimensions, and it is found that off-axial aberrations may need to be considered for focal series of large areas. It is shown that oversized or annular apertures theoretically improve the vertical resolution for 3D imaging of nanoparticles. When imaging nanoparticles of several nanometer size, regular STEM can thereby be optimized such that the vertical full-width at half-maximum approaches that of the aberration-corrected STEM with a standard aperture.},

	abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography was applied to biological specimens such as yeast cells, HEK293 cells and primary culture neurons. These cells, which were embedded in a resin, were cut into 1-$\mu$m-thick sections. STEM tomography offers several important advantages including: (1) it is effective even for thick specimens, (2) {\textquoteleft}dynamic focusing{\textquoteright}, (3) ease of using an annular dark field (ADF) mode and (4) linear contrasts. It has become evident that STEM tomography offers significant advantages for the observation of thick specimens. By employing STEM tomography, even a 1-$\mu$m-thick specimen (which is difficult to observe by conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM)) was successfully analyzed in three dimensions. The specimen was tilted up to 73{\textdegree} during data acquisition. At a large tilt angle, the specimen thicknesses increase dramatically. In order to observe such thick specimens, we introduced a special small condenser aperture that reduces the collection angle of the STEM probe. The specimen damage caused by the convergent electron beam was expected to be the most serious problem; however, the damage in STEM was actually smaller than that in TEM. In this study, the irradiation damage caused by TEM- and STEM-tomography in biological specimens was quantitatively compared.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, in computed tomography practiced in radiology, the resolution of the reconstruction is expressed in terms of the number of evenly spaced projections required for the faithful reconstruction of an object that has a given diameter (see equation (10) below).The tacit assumption is that projection data have a sufficient spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) in the whole frequency range in order to reproduce the object faithfully. In electron microscopy, the situation is dramatically different, as the electron dose limitations result in very low SSNR in the individual projections. The suppression of signal is particularly severe in high spatial frequencies, where the signal is affected by the envelope function of the microscope and the high amount of ambient noise, as well as in some low spatial frequency regions (due to the influence of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the electron microscope). In single-particle reconstruction, a satisfactory level of the SSNR in the 3D reconstruction is achieved by including a large number of 2D projections (tens to hundreds of thousands) that are averaged during the reconstruction process. Except for rare cases (Boisset et al., 1998), the angular distribution of projections is not an issue, as the large number of molecules and the randomness of their orientations on the support grid all but guarantee uniform coverage of angular space. The concern is whether the number of projections per angular direction is sufficient to yield the desired SSNR or whether the angular distribution of projections is such that the oversampling of the 3D Fourier space achieved during the reconstruction process will yield the desired SSNR.},

	abstract = {Despite much progress in electron tomography, quantitative assessment of resolution has remained a problematic issue. The criteria that are used in single particle analysis, based on gauging the consistency between density maps calculated from half data sets, are not directly applicable because of the uniqueness of a tomographic volume. Here, we propose two criteria based on a cross-validation approach. One, called FSCe/o, is based on a Fourier shell correlation comparison between tomograms calculated from the even and odd members of a tilt series. The other, called noise-compensated leave-one-out (NLOO), is based on Fourier ring correlation comparisons between an original projection and the corresponding reprojection of the tomogram calculated from all the other projections, taking into account the differing noise statistics. Plotted as a function of tilt angle, they allow assessment of the angular dependence of resolution and quality control over the series of projections. Integrated over all projections, the results give a global figure for resolution. Tests on simulated tomograms established consistency between these criteria and the FSCref, a correlation coefficient calculated between a known reference structure and the corresponding portion of a tomogram containing that structure. The two criteria{\textemdash}FSCe/o and NLOO{\textemdash}are mutually consistent when residual noise is the major resolution-limiting factor. When the size of the tilt increment becomes a significant factor, NLOO provides a more reliable criterion, as expected, although it is computationally intensive. Applicable to entire tomograms or selected structures, NLOO has also been tested on experimental tomographic data.},

The Volta potential is negative, indicating that it is not caused by beam-induced electrostatic charging. The film must be heated to \~{}200 {\textdegree}C to prevent contamination and enable the Volta potential effect. The phase shift is created {\textquotedblleft}on the fly{\textquotedblright} by the central diffraction beam eliminating the need for precise phase plate alignment. Images acquired with the Volta phase plate (VPP) show higher contrast and unlike Zernike phase plate images no fringing artifacts. Following installation into the microscope, the VPP has an initial settling time of about a week after which the phase shift behavior becomes stable. The VPP has a long service life and has been used for more than 6 mo without noticeable degradation in performance. The mechanism underlying the VPP is the same as the one responsible for the degradation over time of the performance of thin-film Zernike phase plates, but in the VPP it is used in a constructive way. The exact physics and/or chemistry behind the process causing the Volta potential are not fully understood, but experimental evidence suggests that radiation-induced surface modification combined with a chemical equilibrium between the surface and residual gases in the vacuum play an important role.},

Here we present a forward model that accounts for the specimen{\textquoteright}s scattering properties, microscope optics, and detector response. The specimen interaction potential is calculated with the isolated atom superposition approximation (IASA) and extended with the influences of solvent{\textquoteright}s dielectric and ionic properties as well as the molecular electrostatic distribution. We account for an effective charge redistribution via the Poisson{\textendash}Boltzmann approach and find that the IASA-based potential forms the dominant part of the interaction potential, as the contribution of the redistribution is less than 10\%. The electron wave is propagated through the specimen by a multislice approach and the influence of the optics is included via the contrast transfer function. We incorporate the detective quantum efficiency of the camera due to the difference between signal and noise transfer characteristics, instead of using only the modulation transfer function. The full model was validated against experimental images of 20S proteasome, hemoglobin, and GroEL. The simulations adequately predict the effects of phase contrast, changes due to the integrated electron flux, thickness, inelastic scattering, detective quantum efficiency and acceleration voltage. We suggest that beam-induced specimen movements are relevant in the experiments whereas the influence of the solvent amorphousness can be neglected. All simulation parameters are based on physical principles and, when necessary, experimentally determined.},

Filtered-backprojection (FBP)-based algorithms have been developed previously for approximate and exact reconstruction of the entire image or a region of interest within the image in circular cone-beam and fan-beam cases. Recently, we have developed a 3D FBP-based algorithm for image reconstruction on PI-line segments in a helical cone-beam scan. In this work, we demonstrated that the 3D FBP-based algorithm indeed provided a rather general formulation for image reconstruction from divergent projections (such as cone-beam and fan-beam projections). On the basis of this formulation we derived new approximate or exact algorithms for image reconstruction in circular cone-beam or fan-beam scans, which can be interpreted as special cases of the helical scan. Existing algorithms corresponding to the derived algorithms were identified. We also performed a preliminary numerical study to verify our theoretical results in each of the cases. The results in the work can readily be generalized to other non-circular trajectories.},

They did not provide a mathematical justification for their concept. Our paper provides this, by showing (in the idealized case of noiseless data being available for all projection directions) that the reconstructions obtained based on DGCBP from data produced with distance-dependent blurring are essentially the same as what is obtained by a classical method of reconstruction of a 3D object from its line integrals. The approach is general enough to be applicable for correcting for any distance-dependent blurring during projection data collection. We present a new implementation of the DGCBP concept, one that closely follows the mathematics of its justifications, and illustrate it using mathematically described phantoms and their reconstructions from finitely many distance-dependently blurred projections.},

For simulating the next step in resolution improvement we show that it is important to revisit these two approximations as well as their limitations. Here we start off by inspecting both approximations separately to derive their respective conditions of applicability. The thick-phase grating approximation (TPGA) imposes less strict conditions on the interaction potential than PA or WPOA and gives comparable exit waves as a multislice calculation. We suggest the ranges of applicability for four models (PA, PA+WPOA, WPOA, and TPGA) given different interaction potentials using exit wave simulations. The conditions of applicability for the models are based on two measures, a worst-case (safest) and an average criterion. This allows us to present a practical guideline for when to use each image formation model depending on the spatial frequency, thickness and strength of the interaction potential of a macromolecular complex.},

	abstract = {Theoretical foundation and design considerations of a clinical feasible x-ray phase contrastimaging technique were presented in this paper. Different from the analysis of imaging phase object with weak absorption in literature, we proposed a new formalism for in-line phase-contrast imaging to analyze the effects of four clinically important factors on the phase contrast. These are the body parts attenuation, the spatial coherence of spherical waves from a finite-size focal spot, and polychromatic x-ray and radiation doses to patients for clinical applications. The theory presented in this paper can be applied widely in diagnostic x-ray imaging procedures. As an example, computer simulations were conducted and optimal design parameters were derived for clinical mammography. The results of phantom experiments were also presented which validated the theoretical analysis and computer simulations.},

Contrast improvements can be achieved at doses rather less than those required by conventional x-ray imaging. The use of synchrotrons has revealed the possibilities offered by these techniques but unfortunately the application of these ideas in a clinical context requires that technology be pushed to its limits in a number of areas including x-ray sources, optics and detectors.

They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical algorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed-form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpretations of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

The MC reconstruction method we have developed operates by concurrently, rather than independently as is done conventionally, reconstructing tomographic images of the three object properties (absorption, small-angle scattering, refractive index). By jointly estimating the object properties by use of an appropriately defined penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) estimator, the 2nd order statistical properties of the object property sinograms, including correlations between them, can be fully exploited to improve the variance vs. resolution tradeoff of the reconstructed images as compared to existing methods. Channel-independent regularization strategies are proposed. To solve the MC reconstruction problem, we developed an advanced algorithm based on the proximal point algorithm and the augmented Lagrangian method. By use of experimental and computer-simulation data, we demonstrate that by exploiting inter-channel noise correlations, the MC reconstruction method can improve image quality in GB-XPCT.},

	abstract = {Phase contrast tomography has developed rapidly within the last ten years. The new method enables the reconstruction of the refraction index in addition to the attenuation coefficient and can therefore be very well applied to samples which are only weakly absorbing. First studies in phase contract tomography were done using synchrotron devices which are modeled by the so-called parallel geometry. Samples studied so far are special foams and fiber materials, see Cloetens et al (1999 App. Phys. Lett. 75 2912{\textendash}4), which give almost no contrast due to absorption but provide excellent images in phase contrast. Recently tubes were successfully applied to a variety of applications. These laboratory devices no longer fulfil the requirement of a parallel geometry but need to be treated as a fan/cone beam geometry. In this paper we derive a mathematical model for cone beam geometry in phase contrast tomography in two and three dimensions for objects small compared to the two distances of object to detector and x-ray source to object. All approximations needed are analyzed and an efficient reconstruction method providing both phase and absorption in a single step is derived, based on the method by Louis and Maa{\ss} (1990 Inverse Problems 6 427{\textendash}39). The reconstruction method is successfully tested using numerical examples with simulated phantom data.},

These algorithm objects are implemented using the Rice Vector Library (RVL) interface, decoupling the algorithmic code from the details of linear algebra and calculus in Hilbert Space. I made many improvements to the RVL design, including abstract return types for reductions. These improvements allowed me to demonstrate the breadth of this design by incorporating semantically similar objects from other packages which had significant syntatic differences to the RVL objects. By adapting other libraries, I gain access to a variety of tools, including parallel linear algebra implementations. The benefits of the algorithm framework can be seen when abstract numerical algorithms are coupled with parallel simulators without needing to modify either the algorithm or the simulator.},

A rate of O(1/k)O(1/k)\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}(1/k) for restricted primal{\textendash}dual gaps evaluated for ergodic sequences generated by the PDR iteration is established. Based on PDR, new fast iterative algorithms for TV-denoising, TV-deblurring, and TGV-denoising of second order with L2L2L{\textasciicircum}2 and L1L1L{\textasciicircum}1 discrepancy are proposed. While for denoising, symmetric (block) Red{\textendash}Black Gauss{\textendash}Seidel preconditioners are effective, fast Fourier transform-based preconditioners are employed for the deblurring problems. Finally, for the L2L2L{\textasciicircum}2-TGV-denoising problem, an effective modified primal{\textendash}dual gap is developed which may serve as a stopping criterion. All algorithms are tested and compared in numerical experiments. In particular, for problems where strong convexity does not hold, it turns out that the proposed preconditioning techniques are beneficial and lead to competitive results.},

This problem leads in a natural way to a mixture of Sobolev and total variation norms. The main results are obtained under the assumption that p is strongly log-H{\"o}lder continuous and bounded. To motivate our approach we also consider the one-dimensional case and give examples which justify our assumptions. The results can be applied in the analysis of a model for image restoration combining total variation and isotropic smoothing.

However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

The fractional Fourier transform and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful for such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with prime lengths, computing DFTs of sparse sequences, analyzing sequences with noninteger periodicities, performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation, detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals with linearly drifting frequencies. In many cases, the resulting algorithms are faster by arbitrarily large factors than conventional techniques.},

	doi = {10.1118/1.1861792},
	abstract = {The general goal of this paper is to extend the parallel-beam projection-slice theorem to divergent fan-beam and cone-beam projections without rebinning the divergent fan-beam and cone-beam projections into parallel-beam projections directly. The basic idea is to establish a novel link between the local Fourier transform of the projection data and the Fourier transform of the image object. Analogous to the two- and three-dimensional parallel-beam cases, the measured projection data are backprojected along the projection direction and then a local Fourier transform is taken for the backprojected data array. However, due to the loss of the shift invariance of the image object in a single view of the divergent-beam projections, the measured projection data is weighted by a distance dependent weight w(r) before the local Fourier transform is performed. The variable r in the weighting function w(r) is the distance from the backprojected point to the x-ray source position. It is shown that a special choice of the weighting function, w(r)=1/r, will facilitate the calculations and a simple relation can be established between the Fourier transform of the image function and the local Fourier transform of the 1/r-weighted backprojection data array. Unlike the parallel-beam cases, a one-to-one correspondence does not exist for a local Fourier transform of the backprojected data array and a single line in the two-dimensional (2D) case or a single slice in the 3D case of the Fourier transform of the image function. However, the Fourier space of the image object can be built up after the local Fourier transforms of the 1/r-weighted backprojection data arrays are shifted and then summed in a laboratory frame. Thus the established relations Eq. (27) and Eq. (29) between the Fourier space of the image object and the Fourier transforms of the backprojected data arrays can be viewed as a generalized projection-slice theorem for divergent fan-beam and cone-beam projections. Once the Fourier space of the image function is built up, an inverse Fourier transform could be performed to reconstruct tomographic images from the divergent beam projections. Due to the linearity of the Fourier transform, an image reconstruction step can be performed either when the complete Fourier space is available or in parallel with the building of the Fourier space. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the generalized projection-slice theorem by using a disc phantom in the fan-beam case.},

	abstract = {While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning, and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this paper, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics such as the Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

This occurs e.g. in medical applications when fast moving organs like the lungs or the heart are imaged. Most regularization methods are based on the assumption that the object is static during the measuring procedure. Hence, their application in the dynamic case often leads to serious motion artefacts in the reconstruction. Therefore, an algorithm has to take into account the temporal changes of the investigated object. In this paper, a reconstruction method that compensates for the motion of the object is derived for dynamic linear inverse problems. The algorithm is validated at numerical examples from computerized tomography.},

	abstract = {Projections onto sets are used in a wide variety of methods in optimization theory but not every method that uses projections really belongs to the class of projection methods as we mean it here. Here, projection methods are iterative algorithms that use projections onto sets while relying on the general principle that when a family of (usually closed and convex) sets is present, then projections (or approximate projections) onto the given individual sets are easier to perform than projections onto other sets (intersections, image sets under some transformation, etc.) that are derived from the given family of individual sets. Projection methods employ projections (or approximate projections) onto convex sets in various ways. They may use different kinds of projections and, sometimes, even use different projections within the same algorithm. They serve to solve a variety of problems which are either of the feasibility or the optimization types. They have different algorithmic structures, of which some are particularly suitable for parallel computing, and they demonstrate nice convergence properties and/or good initial behavioural patterns. This class of algorithms has witnessed great progress in recent years and its member algorithms have been applied with success to many scientific, technological and mathematical problems. This annotated bibliography includes books and review papers on, or related to, projection methods that we know about, use and like.

	abstract = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of delta 2G(x,y)*I(x,y) for image I, where G(x,y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and delta 2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround delta 2G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr \& Ullman 1979).},

In this work we introduce a more flexible way of sparse regularization by varying exponents. We introduce the corresponding functional analytic framework, that leaves the setting of normed spaces but works with so-called F-norms. One curious result is that there are F-norms which generate the l 1 space, but they are strictly convex, while the l 1 -norm is just convex.},

	doi = {10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/8505},
	abstract = {Recently, the compressed sensing (CS) based iterative reconstruction method has received attention because of its ability to reconstruct cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images with good quality using sparsely sampled or noisy projections, thus enabling dose reduction. However, some challenges remain. In particular, there is always a tradeoff between image resolution and noise/streak artifact reduction based on the amount of regularization weighting that is applied uniformly across the CBCT volume. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel low-dose CBCT reconstruction algorithm framework called priori mask guided image reconstruction ( p -MGIR) that allows reconstruction of high-quality low-dose CBCT images while preserving the image resolution. In p- MGIR, the unknown CBCT volume was mathematically modeled as a combination of two regions: (1) where anatomical structures are complex, and (2) where intensities are relatively uniform. The priori mask, which is the key concept of the p- MGIR algorithm, was defined as the matrix that distinguishes between the two separate CBCT regions where the resolution needs to be preserved and where streak or noise needs to be suppressed. We then alternately updated each part of image by solving two sub-minimization problems iteratively, where one minimization was focused on preserving the edge information of the first part while the other concentrated on the removal of noise/artifacts from the latter part. To evaluate the performance of the p- MGIR algorithm, a numerical head-and-neck phantom, a Catphan 600 physical phantom, and a clinical head-and-neck cancer case were used for analysis. The results were compared with the standard Feldkamp-Davis-Kress as well as conventional CS-based algorithms. Examination of the p- MGIR algorithm showed that high-quality low-dose CBCT images can be reconstructed without compromising the image resolution. For both phantom and the patient cases, the p- MGIR is able to achieve a clinically-reasonable image with 60 projections. Therefore, a clinically-viable, high-resolution head-and-neck CBCT image can be obtained while cutting the dose by 83\%. Moreover, the image quality obtained using p- MGIR is better than the quality obtained using other algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel low-dose CBCT reconstruction algorithm called p- MGIR. It can be potentially used as a CBCT reconstruction algorithm with low dose scan requests},

	abstract = {Tomography produces the reconstruction of a function f from a large number of line integrals of f. Conventional tomography is a global procedure in that the standard convolution formulas for reconstruction at a single point require the integrals over all lines within some plane containing the point. Local tomography, as introduced initially, produced the reconstruction of the related function \${\textbackslash}Lambda f\$, where \${\textbackslash}Lambda \$ is the square root of \$ - {\textbackslash}Delta \$, the positive Laplace operator. The reconstruction of \${\textbackslash}Lambda f\$ is local in that reconstruction at a point requires integrals only over lines passing infinitesimally close to the point, and \${\textbackslash}Lambda f\$ has the same smooth regions and boundaries as f. However, \${\textbackslash}Lambda f\$ is cupped in regions where f is constant. \${\textbackslash}Lambda {\textasciicircum}\{ - 1\} f\$, also amenable to local reconstruction, is smooth everywhere and contains a counter-cup. This article provides a detailed study of the actions of \${\textbackslash}Lambda \$ and \${\textbackslash}Lambda {\textasciicircum}\{ - 1\} \$, and shows several examples of what can be achieved with a linear combination. It includes the results of x-ray experiments in which the line integrals are obtained from attenuation measurements on two-dimensional image intensifiers and fluorescent screens, instead of the usual linear detector arrays.},

	abstract = {We hypothesize that improved quantification for PET imaging of high atomic number materials can be achieved by combining low-dose x-ray imaging with dual energy CT for PET attenuation correction. Improved quantification of tracer uptake will lead to improved patient outcomes by providing more accurate information for therapeutic choices. Accurate PET/CT measurements of early response will be critical in determining the best cancer therapy option for each patient in a timely manner and in sparing patients the morbidity and cost of ineffective treatments. We first evaluate the potential errors in PET images arising from CT-based attenuation correction when iodine-based contrast is incorrectly classified as bone when forming the linear attenuation coefficient image. We then investigate two methods of reducing errors in the linear attenuation image: an approximate, but fast, hybrid classification/scaling algorithm and a model-based dual-energy CT method that incorporates the polyenergetic spectrum and a noise model in an iterative reconstruction method. Both methods are shown to reduce errors in the estimated linear attenuation coefficient image, but require further study to determine the effects of noise propagation if low-dose CT scans are used for the estimation of the linear attenuation image.},

Microlocal analysis is used to determine the relationship between the singularities of a function f and those of its X-ray transform. The results are applied to determine the singularities that are visible for limited angle tomography and the interior and exterior problems. The author also suggests a practical method to use this relationship to reconstruct singularities of f from limited data \$Rf\$.

Since its introduction, it has been one of the most used CPU and GPU mathematical compilers - especially in the machine learning community - and has shown steady performance improvements. Theano is being actively and continuously developed since 2008, multiple frameworks have been built on top of it and it has been used to produce many state-of-the-art machine learning models. The present article is structured as follows. Section I provides an overview of the Theano software and its community. Section II presents the principal features of Theano and how to use them, and compares them with other similar projects. Section III focuses on recently-introduced functionalities and improvements. Section IV compares the performance of Theano against Torch7 and TensorFlow on several machine learning models. Section V discusses current limitations of Theano and potential ways of improving it.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology have enabled the combination of positron emission tomography (PET) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These PET-MRI scanners simultaneously acquire functional PET and anatomical or functional MRI data. As function and anatomy are not independent of one another the images to be reconstructed are likely to have shared structures. We aim to exploit this inherent structural similarity by reconstructing from both modalities in a joint reconstruction framework. The structural similarity between two modalities can be modelled in two different ways: edges are more likely to be at similar positions and/or to have similar orientations. We analyse the diffusion process generated by minimizing priors that encapsulate these different models. It turns out that the class of parallel level set priors always corresponds to anisotropic diffusion which is sometimes forward and sometimes backward diffusion. We perform numerical experiments where we jointly reconstruct from blurred Radon data with Poisson noise (PET) and under-sampled Fourier data with Gaussian noise (MRI). Our results show that both modalities benefit from each other in areas of shared edge information. The joint reconstructions have less artefacts and sharper edges compared to separate reconstructions and the l 2 -error can be reduced in all of the considered cases of under-sampling.},
